        "output":"The objectives of carcinogenicity studies are to identify a tumorigenic potential in animals and to assess the relevant risk in humans. Any cause for concern derived from laboratory investigations, animal toxicology studies, and data in humans may lead to a need for carcinogenicity studies. The practice of requiring carcinogenicity studies in rodents was instituted for pharmaceuticals that were expected to be administered regularly over a substantial part of a patient's lifetime. The design and interpretation of the results from these studies preceded much of the available current technology to test for genotoxic potential and the more recent advances in technologies to assess systemic exposure. These studies also preceded our current understanding of tumorigenesis with non-genotoxic agents. Results from genotoxicity studies, toxicokinetics, and mechanistic studies can now be routinely applied in preclinical safety assessment. These additional data are important not only in considering whether to perform carcinogenicity studies but for interpreting study outcomes with respect to relevance for human safety. Since carcinogenicity studies are time consuming and resource intensive they should only be performed when human exposure warrants the need for information from life-time studies in animals in order to assess carcinogenic potential."

If there was cause for concern, pharmaceuticals generally used continuously for less than 6 months may have needed carcinogenicity studies. In the United States, most pharmaceuticals were tested in animals for their carcinogenic potential before widespread use in humans. According to the US Food and Drug Administration, pharmaceuticals generally used for 3 months or more required carcinogenicity studies. In Europe, the Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the European Community defined the circumstances when carcinogenicity studies were required. These circumstances included administration over a substantial period of life, i.e., continuously during a minimum period of 6 months or frequently in an intermittent manner so that the total exposure was similar."

It is difficult to determine and to justify scientifically what time represents a clinically relevant treatment periods for frequent use with regard to carcinogenic potential, especially for discontinuous treatment periods. For pharmaceuticals used frequently in an intermittent manner in the treatment of chronic or recurrent conditions, carcinogenicity studies are generally needed. Examples of such conditions include allergic rhinitis, depression, and anxiety. Carcinogenicity studies may also need to be considered for certain delivery systems which may result in prolonged exposures.
