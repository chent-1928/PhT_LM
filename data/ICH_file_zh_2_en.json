        "output":"the objectives of carcinogenicity studies are to identify a tumorigenic potential in animals and to assess the relevant risk in humans. any cause for concern derived from laboratory investigations, animal toxicology studies, and data in humans may lead to a need for carcinogenicity studies. the practice of requiring carcinogenicity studies in rodents was instituted for pharmaceuticals that were expected to be administered regularly over a substantial part of a patient's lifetime. the design and interpretation of the results from these studies preceded much of the available current technology to test for genotoxic potential and the more recent advances in technologies to assess systemic exposure. these studies also preceded our current understanding of tumorigenesis with non-genotoxic agents. results from genotoxicity studies, toxicokinetics, and mechanistic studies can now be routinely applied in preclinical safety assessment. these additional data are important not only in considering whether to perform carcinogenicity studies but for interpreting study outcomes with respect to relevance for human safety. since carcinogenicity studies are time consuming and resource intensive they should only be performed when human exposure warrants the need for information from life-time studies in animals in order to assess carcinogenic potential.

Any concerns about any of the factors that have been identified in laboratory studies, animal toxicology studies, or human data may lead to the need for a carcinogenicity test. For drugs that are expected to be used for most of their lives, carcinogenicity testing is usually required. The design and results of these studies are often the latest in the testing of potential genotoxicity of substances. These studies also appear before the current understanding of non-genotoxicity. The results of carcinogenicity testing,毒代动力学和机制研究 have been used for preclinical safety evaluation. These new data not only help to determine whether a carcinogenicity test is needed, but also to explain the relationship between the results of the study and the safety of the human body. Because carcinogenicity testing is time-consuming, only when the human exposure situation is truly needed to evaluate the potential carcinogenicity of substances for lifelong use that the carcinogenicity test is performed."

For esters or complex derivatives, similar data may be valuable in evaluating whether additional carcinogenicity testing is required, but should be analyzed on a case-by-case basis."
