IVRT membranes are selected based upon their effective pore size (e.g., 0.45 micrometers (μm)), as well as their expected inertness to binding the drug. Information should be provided in the IVRT method development report on each membrane’s binding to the drug and its chemical compatibility with relevant receptor solution(s) selected for the IVRT method (based on the preceding phase of IVRT method development), as well as information on the linearity and precision of the resulting release rate when each membrane is used in an IVRT, as this information can help to explain why a specific membrane is optimal for the IVRT method.\n'通常，需要在IVRT方法开发过程中对不同的接收介质进行评估（采用与待评估的接收液具有化学兼容性的同一种膜）；根据药物（通常是疏水性的）在接收液中的溶解性和稳定性，接收介质通常是水-醇二元混合体系。接收液取样频率通常是在6个小时的研究中，每小时至少取样一次。'可被翻译为：It is conventional to evaluate different receptor solutions during IVRT method development (all using the same membrane that has broad chemical compatibility with the receptor solutions evaluated); these receptor solutions are frequently binary hydro-alcoholic mixtures selected based upon the solubility and stability of the (frequently hydrophobic) drug in the receptor solution. The receptor solutions are conventionally sampled at least hourly across a 6-hour duration.\n'在色谱分离前，预先将样品制成适当的衍生物，然后进行分离和检测的操作。'可被翻译为：Before chromatographic separation, the sample is prepared into appropriate derivatives in advance, and then the operation of separation and detection is carried out.\n'对IVRT方法选择性的补充论证而言，在可行的情况下，在IVRT正式研究中，采用相同规格的自研制剂和对照外用制剂，单独确认IVRT方法区分释放速率差异的能力。因此，在可行的情况下，理想的情况是，IVRT方法选择性的补充论证是确认与配方相关的释放速率差异，而不是产品规格。'可被翻译为：A separate and supplemental demonstration of the selectivity of an IVRT method, when feasible, independently validates the ability of the IVRT method to discriminate differences in release rates under the conditions of the pivotal IVRT study, in which the test and reference topical products are compared at the same strength. Thus, the supplemental demonstration of the selectivity of the IVRT method validates that it can detect differences in the release rate that are associated with aspects of the formulation other than the strength, and this is ideal, when feasible.\n'如适用，接收液中样品分析方法的验证应包括相关的稀释完整性确认，以及样品在最高相关温度的接收液中放置最长相关时间的稳定性评估；最高相关温度可以略高于IVRT膜表面温度，因为接收液的温度通常高于膜表面温度（例如，当膜表面温度为32℃时，接收液温度可能是34℃，因此，IVRT接收液的稳定性评估可以设定为34℃维持6小时；而在阴道凝胶制剂的IVRT研究中，温度会更高）。'可被翻译为：The validation of the receptor sample analytical method should include relevant qualifications of dilution integrity, if applicable, as well as stability assessments with the highest relevant temperature in the receptor solution for the longest relevant duration; the highest relevant temperature may be warmer than the IVRT membrane surface temperature because the temperature of the receptor solution is often higher than the temperature at the surface of the membrane (e.g., the temperature of the receptor solution may be 34°C when the temperature of membrane surface is 32°C, so stability assessments with the IVRT receptor solution may be performed at 34°C for 6 hours; the temperature would be higher for an IVRT with a vaginal gel, for example).\n'虽然在IVRT方法开发的探索性研究中，可以采用未验证的样品分析方法，但作为IVRT方法验证的一部分，在IVRT方法验证时，必须采用已验证的样品分析方法。已验证的IVRT方法应当使用已验证的接收液样品分析方法。因此，该部分讨论用于IVRT方法的样品分析方法。'可被翻译为：While exploratory studies performed during IVRT method development may use an unvalidated sample analytical method, it is essential that all studies conducted as part of the IVRT method validation use a validated sample analytical method.

Therefore, a discussion of the sample analytical method for the IVRT method is included in this guidance under this section.\n'需要注意的是，与IVRT方法相关的研究方案和报告与用于IVRT接收液中样品定量的分析方法不同。样品分析方法验证，就其本身而言，并不能证明IVRT方法的有效性。因此，应分别递交样品分析方法（如，HPLC或UPLC）和IVPT方法的验证报告。'可被翻译为：It is important to note that the study protocols and reports related to the IVRT method are distinct from those for the sample analytical method that is used to quantify drug concentrations in IVRT receptor solution samples.

Consequently, the choice of freezing system or method has a smaller effect on the viability of the cell bank. Filled cryocontainers simply can be transferred into an approximately −80° freezer overnight followed by transfer to vapor phase liquid nitrogen. Alternatively, microbial cell banks may not use liquid nitrogen storage but can be stored at approximately−80°. However, if liquid-nitrogen storage is available, it is preferred for long-term storage (e.g., years). If acontrolled-rate freezer is employed, then it should be fully qualitied to deliver a uniform cooling rate that is within an expected range, e.g.,1°–5°\/min.\n'冷冻过程完成后，产品从控制速率或机械冷冻机转移到低温存储单元。一些微生物细胞培养物可以适当地保存在冰箱中，但应证实这一点。在将细胞产品从冷冻设备转移到存储设备的过程中，应尽量减少样品的升温。可以使用冷桌或隔热传输装置来减少传送过程中的温度升高。通常，在完成对不定因子的测试之前，应将新冷冻保存的细胞放置在隔离的低温存储单元中。在测试之后，将不定因子测试呈阴性的细胞转移到长期低温存储单元中。'可被翻译为：After the freezing process has been completed, products are transferred fromcontrolled-rate or mechanical freezers to cryogenic storage units. Some microbial cell cultures can be suitably maintained in mechanical freezers but this should be demonstrated. Sample warming should be minimized during transfer of the cell product from the freezing device to storage. Cold tables or insulated transfer devices can be used to minimize warming during transfer.Newly cryopreserved cells commonly are placed in a quarantine cryogenic storage unit before completion of testing for adventitious agents. After testing, cells that test negative for adventitious agents can be released for transfer intolong-term cryogenic storage units.\n'使用受控速率冷冻装置可更精确地控制冷冻环境，从而在细胞外冰晶形成时为冷却速率范围狭窄（与最大存活率相关）或敏感的细胞提供更一致（且更高）的解冻后恢复能力。将温度探针放置在要冷冻的细胞附近或同时进行低温保存的模拟细胞悬液中，用于监视冷冻过程并提供过程控制。如果融合潜热的释放被延迟或控制不当，则进行冷冻保存的细胞可能会受到破坏，并且复苏后的活力可能会降低。'可被翻译为：The useof controlled-rate freezing provides more precise control of the freezingenvironment and therefore may provide more consistent (and higher) post-thaw recoveryfor cells that may have a narrow range of cooling rates associated with maximum survival or cells that are sensitive to the temperature at which ice forms in theextracellular solution.

        "instruction":"已知信息：\n'低温保护剂溶液通常是高渗的而不是生理的。例如，通常用于细胞冻存的10% DMSO溶液的浓度大约为1.4摩尔渗透压浓度(Osm\/L)。随着细胞失水，引入这种类型溶液中的细胞迅速脱水，以减少细胞内外的渗透压差。DMSO缓慢渗透到细胞内使其重新平衡。这可能会导致体积偏移，从而导致细胞活力的丧失。因此，冷冻保存溶液通常是逐步添加或逐渐地(如使用注射泵)或从容器的侧面缓慢添加到细胞悬浮液中，以防止由于渗透压造成细胞损失。应开发引入或去除冷冻保存液的方法并评估其对细胞活力和功能的影响。'可被翻译为：Cryoprotectant solutions typically are hypertonic and are not physiological. For example, a10% DMSO solution used commonly in cell preservation has a concentration of approximately 1.4 osmolarity (Osm\/L). Cells introduced into this type of solution rapidly dehydrate as water leaves the cell in order to reduce the difference in osmotic potential between the inside and outside of the cell. DMSO slowly permeates the cell to re-equilibrate. This may cause excursions in volume that can result in a loss of cell viability. Therefore, cryopreservation solutions commonly are added to a cell suspension in stepwise additions or gradually(e.g.,using asy ringe pump) or slowly dispensing down the side of the container to prevent cell losses resulting from osmotic stress. The method for introducing or removing a cryopreservation solution should be developed and evaluated for its impact on cell viability and functionality.\n'DMSO对溶液中的细胞有毒。在输注或进一步处理之前，可通过稀释或洗涤细胞悬液来降低毒性。由于冻存过程中当细胞从高渗溶液过渡到等渗溶液时，融化的细胞对体积膨胀更敏感，稀释和洗涤溶液的方法必须仔细设计和验证。使用常规离心机或自动化设备进行细胞洗涤会给细胞带来额外的机械应力，因此具体在临床实践中，必须通过恰当的方法评估细胞损失。'可被翻译为：DMSO is toxic to cells in liquid suspension. Toxicity maybe reduced by diluting or washing the cell suspension before infusion orfurther manipulation. Because cryopreserved, thawed cells are more sensitive tovolumetric expansion when the cells transition from a hypertonic solution to anisotonic solution, the dilution and washing solutions and methods must becarefully designed and validated. Cell washing using either a conventionalcentrifuge or an automated device can result in additional mechanical stress tothe cells, so cell losses must be assessed by an appropriate method before aspecific method isimplemented in clinical practice.\n'不同的方法可以完成此步骤，但分析人员应充分稀释DMSO，并将细胞恢复到正常的等渗生长环境。由于冻融过程引起的压力，应尽量减少对解冻后即刻细胞的操作。例如，应尽量减少移液和离心。'可被翻译为：Differentmethods can accomplish this step, but analysts should achieve suffcientdilution of the DMSO and return the cells to their normal isotonic growthenvironment. Manipulation of cells immediately post-thaw should be minimizedbecause of the stresses induced by the freeze–thaw process. For example,pipetting and centrifugation should be minimized.\n'由于冻存液不是生理性的，所以一些解冻后的处理并不少见。对于保存在DMSO中的细胞，通常会在解冻后立即清洗或稀释细胞，因为这种CPA尤其对冷冻和融化的细胞有害。细胞对膨胀比收缩更敏感，因此必须仔细优化CPA去除或稀释方案，以防止细胞因稀释或CPA的去除而损失。'可被翻译为：Because cryopreservationsolutions are not physiological, it is not uncommon for some post-thawprocessing to be performed. For cells preserved in DMSO, cells typically arewashed or diluted immediately post-thaw because this CPA is harmful inparticular to frozen and thawed cells. Cells are more sensitive to expansionthan contraction, so CPA removal or dilution protocols must be carefullyoptimized to prevent cell losses from dilution or removal.\n'细胞离心后，立即从细胞沉淀中除去培养基，并通过缓慢添加预冷的冻存培养基轻轻重悬细胞。根据活细胞数量和目标细胞浓度（通常，细胞库活细胞密度大约1×107个细胞\/ mL），立即用适当体积的冷冻保存介质稀释细胞悬液。如上一节所述，冷冻储藏介质是高渗的，应限制暴露时间。将最终的细胞悬浮液转移到一个容器中，在小瓶灌装期间可以在其中轻轻混合细胞，促进细胞库的均匀性。'可被翻译为：Immediately following centrifugation of cells, growth medium is removed from cell pellets,and cells are gently resuspended by slow addition of cryopreservation medium that is often precooled for many cell types. The cell suspension is immediately diluted with an appropriate volume of cryopreservation medium based on viable cell count and targeted cell density (typically, cell banks are produced at aviable cell density of approximately 1 × 107 cells\/mL). As mentionedin the previous section, cryopreservation medium is highly hypertonic, and exposure time should be limited. The\n'临床使用的造血干细胞可以从骨髓、外周血或脐带血中获得。每种来源对冻存都有其特殊的要求。例如，外周血祖细胞（UCB）产品含有大量的细胞，并且可以在具有较高细胞浓度的多个袋中冷冻。UCB的保存方案可能包括使用注射泵引入冻存液，同时最大程度减少渗透压力。对于UCB，通常在解冻后使用专门的溶液来稀释或去除DMSO，同时最大程度降低细胞渗透压力。'可被翻译为：HSCs cryopreserved for clinical use may be obtained from bone marrow, mobilized peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood (UCB). Each source has unique requirements for preservation. For example, peripheral blood progenitor cell products contain larger numbers of cells and may be frozen in multiple bags with relatively high cell concentrations. Protocols for UCB preservation may include the use of syringe pumps to introduce cryopreservation solutions while minimizing osmotic stresses. For UCB, specialized solutions often are used after thaw to dilute or remove DMSO while minimizing osmotic stress for the cells.\n'淋巴细胞用于多种临床应用，包括治疗癌症、病毒感染和自身免疫性疾病的免疫治疗。基于淋巴细胞的疗法可以由已经体外选择或激活的混合淋巴细胞群或淋巴细胞亚群组成，例如调节性T细胞、自然杀伤细胞和活化的T细胞。与造血细胞一样，淋巴细胞通常使用10%的DMSO溶液冷冻保存，冷却速度控制在1℃\/min。'可被翻译为：Lymphocytes are used for a variety ofclinical applications including immunotherapy to treat cancer, viral infection,and autoimmune disease. Therapy based on lymphocytes may consist of mixedlymphocyte populations or lymphocyte subpopulations that have been selected oractivated ex vivo, e.g., regulatory T cells, natural killer cells, andactivated T cells. As with hematopoietic cells, lymphocytes typically arecryopreserved using a 10% DMSO solution and a controlled cooling rate of1°\/min.\n'CPA具有超出其防冻特性的生物学活性。诸如DMSO等，可能会影响细胞膜、细胞骨架和基因表达，并且在细胞长时间暴露后可能对细胞有毒。因此，在开发新的低温保存方案的过程中，分析人员应进行毒性试验，将细胞在一定时间间隔内暴露于CPA，以评估活力丧失或功能改变。'可被翻译为：CPAs have biological activities beyond their cryoprotective properties. Some, like DMSO,can affect the cell membrane, cytoskeleton, and gene expression and may be toxic to cells following prolonged exposure. Therefore, during development of new cryopreservation protocols analysts should perform a toxicity assay in which the cells are exposed to the CPA over a range of time intervals to evaluate loss of viability or alteration of functionality.\n\n根据上述已知信息，请将'对于DMSO，当两种溶液混合时，会产生较大的混合焓导致样品加热。这种加热的温度可能会高到足以损坏细胞的程度，因此通常将包含DMSO的溶液在混合前进行预冷。预冷可减少溶液混合过程中产生的热量，减少细胞渗透体积的变化，并减少细胞暴露于DMSO中的损伤。在冷冻之前，对细胞暴露于冷冻保护剂的时间应加以限制，并且常规研发工作中确定允许无有害影响的最大允许时间。'翻译为英文，只能输出翻译后的句子，不允许添加编造成分。",

This heating can be high enough to damage the cells, so solutions that contain DMSO commonly are precooled before mixing.Prechilling the solution reduces heating associated with mixing of the solution, reducesthe osmotic volume changes that the cells experience, and reduces cell lossesassociated with exposure to DMSO. The time that cells are exposed to the cryoprotectant,prior to freezing, should be limited and the maximum time allowable, withoutdeleterious effects, should be determined during development work for routineuse."

An inert support membrane (i.e., a synthetic membrane validated for use with an IVRT method for the same drug product) may be used beneath the skin, as appropriate, as long as it does not impede the diffusion of the drug from the skin to the receptor solution. The donor compartment should then be installed on top of the skin ensuring that the skin is mounted securely in the diffusion cell. The receptor compartment may be filled with receptor solution either before or after mounting of the skin. Any bubbles underneath the skin should be removed by tipping the cell and guiding the bubble up the sampling arm. The thermoregulatory mechanism of the VDC system should then be utilized to equilibrate the skin to the target temperature.\n'VDC由两个隔室(供体隔室和带采样臂的受体隔室)组成，隔室由膜隔开，并通过夹钳、螺旋顶或其他方式连接在一起(见图1-5)。VDC主体(即，供体和受体隔室与相关的池体结构，如采样臂和水套，如果存在)通常由硼硅酸盐玻璃制成，尽管可以使用不同的材料来制造主体和VDC组件的其他部分。通常可以使用与图1-3所示扩散池在设计原理和特征上相似的其他扩散池。'可被翻译为：A VDC consists of two compartments (a donor compartment and a receptor compartment with a sampling arm) separated by a membrane and held together by a clamp, screw top, or other means (see Figures 1–5). The VDC body (i.e., donor and receptor compartment with associated cell structures like the sampling arm and water jacket, if present) is usually made from borosilicate glass, although different materials may be used to manufacture the body and other parts of the VDC assembly. Other diffusion cells that are similar in design principles and features to those depicted in Figures 1–3 can generally be used.\n'FDC连接到泵、流入管和流出管。当所有用于测试的FDC都连接到泵上时，可能需要从受体隔间中清除气泡。一种典型的方法是将池体向上倾斜，使样品流出管升高，同时泵以高速运行，这有助于通过流出的受体溶液从皮肤下去除气泡。当所有空气从受体室中被清除后，泵就可以停止了。应将池体降低到测试位置并使其平衡。'可被翻译为：The FDC is connected to a pump and inflow as well as outflow tubing. When all the FDC for testing are connected to pumps, air bubbles may need to be purged from the receptor compartments. A typical method is the cells are tipped upward, with the outflow sample line raised, while the pump is run at a high speed which facilitates the removal of the air bubble from under the skin via the outflowing receptor solution. The pump can be stopped after all air has been purged from the receptor compartment.

Filter membranes comprised of a synthetic material, sometimes with different pore sizes, are commonly evaluated during IVRT method development. Other types of simple, monolayer synthetic membranes, like dialysis membranes, may also be suitable for an IVRT method.

Determinations should be based upon a minimum of three replicate membrane incubations for the IVRT duration at the relevant temperature (e.g., 6 hours at 32°C ± 1°C). Three replicate control incubations should be performed in parallel, without membranes, to monitor for drug loss that is not associated with membrane binding. Aliquots of these solutions should be collected before and after the duration of incubation, to assess any decrease in the amount of drug in solution. The recovery of drug in solution is recommended to be within the range of 100% ± 5% at the end of the test duration to qualify the inertness of the membrane.\n'对IVRT方法选择性的补充论证而言，在可行的情况下，在IVRT正式研究中，采用相同规格的自研制剂和对照外用制剂，单独确认IVRT方法区分释放速率差异的能力。因此，在可行的情况下，理想的情况是，IVRT方法选择性的补充论证是确认与配方相关的释放速率差异，而不是产品规格。'可被翻译为：A separate and supplemental demonstration of the selectivity of an IVRT method, when feasible, independently validates the ability of the IVRT method to discriminate differences in release rates under the conditions of the pivotal IVRT study, in which the test and reference topical products are compared at the same strength.

        "instruction":"已知信息：\n'IVRT专属性是准确监控释放速率变化比例的能力，其中，释放速率为配方制剂中药物浓度的函数。这种比例可以用配方浓度与IVRT平均释放速率（斜率）之间的关系图来说明。通过绘制线性趋势线，量化并报告r2值，来评估IVRT的专属性。IVRT方法对释放速率的响应按线性应呈比例关系，如果配方浓度与IVRT平均释放速率（斜率）的线性相关性r2值≥0.95，则认为该方法具有合适的专属性。'可被翻译为：IVRT specificity is the ability to accurately monitor the proportionality of changes in the release rate as a function of drug concentration in the formulation. This proportionality may be illustrated in a plot of the relationship between the formulation concentration and the average IVRT release rate (slope). The specificity of the IVRT method should be calculated, plotted with a linear trendline, and the linearity quantified and reported as an r2 value. To be considered suitably specific, an IVRT method should be proportionally linear in its response to differences in release rates, with a minimum r2 value ≥ 0.95 for the correlation of the formulation concentration to the average IVRT release rate (slope).\n'IVRT专属性'可被翻译为：IVRT Specificity\n'IVRT旨在表征在一组特定条件下半固体制剂的稳态药物释放率(即，一组给定的方法参数)。IVRT方法通常是精确和可重复的。然而，如果IVRT方法的参数发生变化，则测量的释放率也可能发生变化。值得注意的是，当IVRT方法一致时，测试制剂和参比制剂之间释放速率的变化反映了制剂中物质的物理化学性质和\/或结构排列的差异。因此，IVRT方法可以提供一种敏感和鉴别的方法来监测测试物与参考制剂的物理化学或结构特性的差异。'可被翻译为：An IVRT is intended to characterize a steady-state drug release rate from a semisolid formulation under a specific set of conditions (i.e., a given set of method parameters). IVRT methods are typically precise and reproducible. However, if the parameters of the IVRT method change, then the release rate measured may also change. Notably, when the IVRT method is consistent, then changes in the release rate between a test and reference formulation are reflective of a difference in the physicochemical properties and\/or the structural arrangement of matter in the formulations. Thus, IVRT methods can provide a sensitive and discriminating way to monitor for differences in the physicochemical or structural properties of a test versus the reference formulation.\n'IVRT选择性是指IVRT方法区分对照外用制剂和改变规格的配方制剂（50%和150%规格）之间，释放速率差异的能力，应证明改变配方制剂规格后，其释放速率与对照外用制剂相比，在统计学上不等效。可以根据USP<1724>中描述的统计学方法，对释放速率的不等效性进行评估。'可被翻译为：IVRT selectivity is the ability of the IVRT method to discriminate the drug release rates between the reference topical product and the altered (50% and 150% nominal strength) concentration test formulations such that their release rates are determined to be statistically inequivalent compared to that from the nominal reference strength formulation. Determination of inequivalence between release rates should be evaluated using the statistical approach described in USP General Chapter<1724>.\n'IVRT灵敏度是检测释放速率变化的能力，其中，释放速率为配方制剂中药物浓度的函数。如果在相同的日期，对RS、较高规格和较低规格的配方制剂进行平行研究，相对于RS，较高规格或较低规格的配方制剂能分别呈现出较高或较低释放速率，则认为IVRT方法是灵敏的。'可被翻译为：IVRT sensitivity is the ability to detect changes in the release rate, as a function of drug concentration in the formulation. If the IVRT method consistently identifies higher or lower rates of release for test formulations with increased or decreased drug concentrations, respectively, relative to the formulation at the nominal strength of the RS run in parallel on the same day, the IVRT method would generally be considered sensitive.\n'采用USP<1724>中描述的统计学方法对释放速率之间的不等效性进行评估。具体来说，将对照标示规格配方制剂与具有相同规格、不同配方制剂的各6杯释放速率，按USP<1724>中描述的统计学方法进行比较。所有12杯应在同一天平行运行，具有相同规格、不同配方制剂的释放速率应与对照标示规格配方制剂的释放速率不等效。'可被翻译为：Determination of inequivalence between release rates should be evaluated using the statistical approach described in USP General Chapter<1724>. Specifically, the release rates from 6 cells dosed with the nominal reference strength formulation should be compared with the release rates from 6 cells dosed with an altered formulation, also at the nominal reference strength, using the statistical approach described in USP General Chapter<1724>. All 12 cells being compared should have been run in parallel on the same day, and the release rate from the altered formulation at the same nominal reference strength should fail to show equivalence to the release rate from the nominal reference strength formulation.\n'因此，不同规格产品释放率的比例线性可能受到不同规格配方差异的影响，而这些差异与IVRT方法的比例响应性无关。因配方差异与IVRT方法无关，且考虑到IVRT方法对释放速率差异的响应可能不是完全成比例的，因此，要求配方浓度与IVRT平均释放率（斜率）相关性的最小r2值≥0.95。'可被翻译为：Thus, the proportional linearity of release rates across different strengths of the product may be impacted by formulation differences across the strengths that are independent of the proportional responsiveness of the IVRT method. The minimum r2 value ≥ 0.95 for the correlation of the formulation concentration to the average IVRT release rate (slope) takes into account that the IVRT method’s response to differences in release rates may not appear to be perfectly proportional because of formulation differences that are independent of the IVRT method.\n'具体来说，将对照标示规格制剂（即100%规格）和150%规格配方制剂各6杯的释放速率，按USP<1724>中描述的统计学方法进行比较。所有12杯应在同一天平行运行，150%规格配方制剂的释放速率应与对照制剂的释放速率不等效。'可被翻译为：Specifically, the release rates from six cells dosed with the nominal reference strength formulation should be compared with the release rates from 6 cells dosed with the formulation at 150% the nominal reference strength, using the statistical approach described in USP General Chapter<1724>. All 12 cells being compared should have been run in parallel on the same day, and the release rate from the formulation at 150% the nominal reference strength should fail to show equivalence to the release rate from the nominal reference strength formulation.\n\n根据上述已知信息，请将'IVRT专属性是不同规格制剂产品释放速率变换比例的函数，其中一些或可能所有配方制剂均是小批量实验室批次，每种规格的配方成分略有不同，以适应不同规格产品中活性成分的不同含量。这种不同规格制剂产品配方的轻微变化可能影响不同规格制剂产品释放速率的理想变化比例。'翻译为英文，只能输出翻译后的句子，不允许添加编造成分。",

IVRT methods are typically precise and reproducible. However, if the parameters of the IVRT method change, then the release rate measured may also change. Notably, when the IVRT method is consistent, then changes in the release rate between a test and reference formulation are reflective of a difference in the physicochemical properties and\/or the structural arrangement of matter in the formulations.
